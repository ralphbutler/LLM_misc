Please write program to play the game of Towers of Hanoi.  It should accept a single cmd-line
arg which is the number of disks in the game.  Print the start and end configuration.
Since large numbers of disks may require many moves, only print individual moves for small numbers.
Print the total number of moves made.

Here are the rules:
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive puzzle that serves as a great
problem for evaluating sequential reasoning and planning capabilities in reasoning models. The
puzzle consists of three pegs (labeled 0, 1, and 2 from left to right) and N disks of varying sizes,
where each disk is uniquely numbered from 1 (smallest) to N (largest). In the initial configuration,
all N disks are stacked on the leftmost peg (peg 0) in descending order of size, with the largest disk
at the bottom and the smallest at the top. The remaining two pegs (1 and 2) are initially empty.
The goal is to transfer all disks from peg 0 to peg 2, maintaining the same size ordering (largest
at bottom, smallest at top). This puzzle is governed by three fundamental constraints: (1) Single
Disk Movement: Only one disk may be moved at a time; (2) Top Disk Access: Only the topmost
disk from any peg can be selected for movement; and (3) Size Ordering Constraint: A larger disk
may never be placed on top of a smaller disk.

From claude after the program was written:
I've created hanoi.py with a smart approach to intermediate state printing:

  For â‰¤4 disks: Shows each move step-by-step with visual tower states, since this is educational
  and manageable (at most 15 moves).

  For >4 disks: Shows only start state, end state, and total move count, since it gets verbose
  quickly (31 moves for 5 disks, 63 for 6 disks, etc.).

  The program includes:
  - Visual ASCII representation of the towers and disks
  - Command-line argument validation
  - Safety warning for very large numbers of disks
  - Move counter that matches the theoretical minimum (2^n - 1)

  You can test it with: python hanoi.py 3 (shows all steps) or python hanoi.py 5 (condensed
  output).
