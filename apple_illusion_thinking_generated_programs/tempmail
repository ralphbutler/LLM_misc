The towers and checkers puzzles are pretty easy for the tester; about all you have to do is
pick a value for N and run the program.  For the river problem, it is more complicated because
you have set two hyper-parameters, N (2N) for travelers, and K for the boat capacity.  Then,
the blocks puzzle can be more complex because not only can you vary the number of blocks, and
the number of stacks, but you also have to choose the starting and ending configurations.

For river, I ran a variety of tests to determine values for N and K that work well together.
For blocks, the authors made a set of simplifying assumptions about number of stacks and start
and end configurations.  So, I went with those and told claude to write the program using
those constraints.

The 4 programs are attached and I think they meet the spirit of the authors' intentions well.

My guess is that the authors of the paper would not be impressed because they were trying to
measure raw reasoning ability of the LLMs.  Whereas we measured code-writing ability.
