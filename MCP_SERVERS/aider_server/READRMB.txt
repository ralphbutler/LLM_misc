To install into Claude Desktop we should normally do something like run uv from:
    add to ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

But because uv when run via Desktop, currently has a bug installing tiktoken, we
are doing this in the file instead:

"aider": {
    "command": "bash",
      "args": [
        "-c",
        "source /Users/rbutler/MCPSERVERS/BAK_aider_server/venv_for_desktop/.venv/bin/activate && python3 /Users/rbutler/MCPSERVERS/BAK_aider_server/aider_server.py"
          ]
    }

NOTE we may need to delete the BAK_ part when going live
