## George Washington (1789-1797)
George Washington was the first President of the United States and is often referred to as the "Father of His Country." Before becoming president, he served as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. As president, he established many of the customs and traditions that still define the role today. He set important precedents such as the two-term limit (which later became law) and established the federal government's authority. Washington was unanimously elected twice and voluntarily stepped down after his second term.

## John Adams (1797-1801)
John Adams served as the first Vice President under George Washington before becoming the second President of the United States. He was a key figure in the American Revolution and helped draft the Declaration of Independence. During his presidency, he faced challenges including the XYZ Affair and tensions with France. His presidency saw the passage of the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts. Adams was the first president to reside in the White House, moving in during his final months in office.

## Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809)
Thomas Jefferson was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and served as the first Secretary of State under Washington before becoming the third President. His presidency is notable for the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, which doubled the size of the United States, and the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Jefferson was a strong advocate for democracy, republicanism, and individual rights. He founded the University of Virginia after his presidency and was known for his wide-ranging interests in architecture, archaeology, science, and philosophy. Jefferson served two terms and is remembered as one of the most influential Founding Fathers.
