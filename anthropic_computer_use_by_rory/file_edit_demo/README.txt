A set of demos for using the file-editing features in the Anthropic computer use API.

The tests:
    – Please create a file called 'ping.txt' and write 'pong' in it.
    – Update pong to foobar in our ping.txt file
    – Add 5 lines that say ping and 5 that say pong at the bottom of our ping.txt file
    – Split the presidents.md file into 3 files, one for each president; name each file with the last name of that president
    – Read the presidents.md file and update it to contain an interesting mermaid diagram regarding the three presidents, LR flowchart
        ## Examine the presidents.md file in VSCode and use the preview panel to see the chart; requires extension Markdown Preview Mermaid Support, or similar

The last test above requests that the mermaid package be used to put a flowchart into a markdown file, which can be previewed with VSCode.
