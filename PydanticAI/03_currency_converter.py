# This demo showcases several key aspects of pydanticAI's dependency system while remaining focused:
# 
# It demonstrates a clear use case for dependencies (exchange rates that need to be accessed by the agent)
# - Shows how to create a typed dependency class using @dataclass
# - Illustrates how to use RunContext to access dependencies in tools
# - Provides a practical example that's not too trivial but also not overly complex
# - Shows how to pass dependencies when running the agent

# This example is self-contained and demonstrates a real-world scenario (currency conversion)
#   that naturally requires external data (exchange rates) to be passed to the agent.

"""Example demonstrating how to use PydanticAI agent dependencies (deps_type).

This example shows how to create an agent that converts currencies using
external exchange rate data passed through dependencies.
