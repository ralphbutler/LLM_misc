I've created a comprehensive implementation of a science information retrieval agent using the
PydanticAI framework. Let me explain what each component does and how they work together:

## Main Components

1. **Science Information Retrieval Agent (`science_agent.py`)**:
   - Defines the core agent using PydanticAI
   - Creates structured output models using Pydantic
   - Implements a scientific terminology lookup tool
   - Supports dependency injection for configurable behavior

2. **Example Usage Script (`example_usage.py`)**:
   - Demonstrates different ways to use the agent
   - Shows how to configure the agent for different detail levels
   - Illustrates using different LLM models
   - Uses Rich for nicely formatted console output

3. **Flask API Integration (`api_demo.py`)**:
   - Shows how to expose the agent via a REST API
   - Includes proper error handling and validation
   - Provides a simple HTML documentation endpoint
   - Demonstrates a real-world usage scenario

4. **README Documentation (`readme.md`)**:
   - Explains installation and usage
   - Documents key concepts and components
   - Provides examples for basic and advanced usage
   - Explains how to extend the agent

## Key Features of the Implementation

### 1. Structured Output with Pydantic Models

The agent uses a hierarchical structure of Pydantic models to define the expected output format:

```python
class ScienceResponse(BaseModel):
    main_concept: ScienceConcept
    explanation: str
    confidence: int
    limitations: str
```

This ensures the LLM's responses are consistently formatted and validated against a schema.

### 2. Dependency Injection

The `ScienceAgentConfig` dataclass allows for configurable behavior:

```python
@dataclass
class ScienceAgentConfig:
    detail_level: int = 5
    max_references: int = 3
    include_limitations: bool = True
    current_date: date = date.today()
```

This is passed to the agent at runtime to customize its behavior without changing the code.

### 3. Dynamic System Prompts

The agent uses both static and dynamic system prompts:

```python
@science_agent.system_prompt
async def add_detail_instruction(ctx: RunContext[ScienceAgentConfig]) -> str:
    detail_level = ctx.deps.detail_level
    return f"Provide responses with a detail level of {detail_level}/10..."
```

This allows the system prompt to adapt based on the provided configuration.

### 4. Tool Functions

The agent includes a tool for terminology lookup:

```python
@science_agent.tool
async def lookup_scientific_terminology(
    ctx: RunContext[ScienceAgentConfig], 
    term: str
) -> str:
    # Implementation...
```

This demonstrates how PydanticAI agents can use tools to enhance their capabilities.

### 5. Model-Agnostic Design

The agent works with different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) and can easily switch between them:

```python
result = science_agent.run_sync(
    "Explain CRISPR gene editing", 
    model="anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest"
)
```

## How to Run the Code

1. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pydantic-ai rich flask
   # or with uv
   uv pip install pydantic-ai rich flask
   ```

2. **Set up API keys**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Run the example script**:
   ```bash
   python example_usage.py
   ```

4. **Or run the Flask API**:
   ```bash
   python api_demo.py
   ```

## Next Steps

To further enhance this implementation, you could:

1. Connect to actual scientific databases and APIs
2. Add streaming responses for long-form explanations
3. Implement caching to improve performance
4. Add additional tools for scientific data analysis
5. Implement user feedback and agent improvement mechanisms

This implementation demonstrates the core features of PydanticAI and how it can be used to build
a practical, type-safe agent for retrieving information from LLMs.
