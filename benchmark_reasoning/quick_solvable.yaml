# Quick Solvable Test Configuration
# 10 problems that should be solvable by reasonable cloud LLMs (e.g., Sonnet-4)
# Mix of easier problems from datasets with implemented evaluation

global_options:
  random_seed: 42
  output_format: "json"

datasets:
  # Easy math word problems - genuinely very solvable

    format: "huggingface"
    config: "main"
    split: "test"
    mode: "counts"
    difficulty_source: "estimated"
    counts:
      easy: 10     # Only the easiest grade school math problems

# Total: 10 problems (all with implemented evaluation)
# Expected performance with good cloud LLM: 90-95% accuracy
# Note: Removed ARC Challenge as some science questions proved trickier than expected
# Suggested timeout: 60-90 seconds
