# Quick Solvable Test Configuration
# 10 problems that should be solvable by reasonable cloud LLMs (e.g., Sonnet-4)
# Mix of easier problems from datasets with implemented evaluation

# Total: 10 problems (all with implemented evaluation)
# Expected performance with good cloud LLM: 90-95% accuracy
# Note: Removed ARC Challenge as some science questions proved trickier than expected
# Suggested timeout: 60-90 seconds
