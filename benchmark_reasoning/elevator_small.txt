Solve this logic riddle in the most effective way.

You are trapped in a skyscraper with an elevator system that operates under
peculiar rules. Each floor has a unique condition that determines how the
elevator moves. Your goal is to reach the top floor (Floor 30) starting from the
ground floor (Floor 0), using the elevator efficiently.

Elevator Rules:
Button A: Moves you up n+1 floors, where n is the current floor number.
          If this action would land you on a floor divisible by 5, the elevator sends you back to n/2.
Button B: Moves you up 4 floors but subtracts 3 from the new floor if the resulting floor is even.
Button C: Moves you down 7 floors, but if the floor you land on is a prime number, you immediately bounce back up 10 floors.
Button D: Moves you to the next floor that is a multiple of 3 (always up).
Button E: Moves you up 2 floors and doubles the number of floors moved if the current floor number is odd.

Challenge:
Determine the shortest sequence of button presses to reach Floor 30.
Track your movement across all floors and provide a step-by-step explanation of your path.
If multiple paths are possible, find the one with the fewest presses and explain why it is optimal.

Extra Layer of Complexity:
Introduce "trap floors":
Trap Floor 13: You cannot press any button other than Button D here.
Trap Floor 22: If you land here, you are forced to go back to Floor 10.
