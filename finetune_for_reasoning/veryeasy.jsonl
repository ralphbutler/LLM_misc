Begin with the given expression: 26 - 91  \n2. Subtract the smaller number (26) from the larger number (91). In this case, we cannot directly subtract 91 from 26 due to the order of numbers. To proceed, we need to borrow one from the tens place of the 26, which makes it 16.  \n3. Now perform subtraction: 16 - 91 = -75 (negative result indicates that the number being subtracted is greater than the number from which it is subtracted)  \n\nRecheck the steps, and answer if there is a discrepancy:  \nUpon reviewing the calculations, I confirmed that the subtraction was done correctly. However, I noticed an error in my initial explanation of borrowing; instead of borrowing one from the tens place to convert 26 into 16, we should convert it to 12 (borrowing two) to facilitate successful subtraction.  \nSo, let's correct that step:  \n\n1. Borrow two from the tens place of 26, converting it into 12 and the ones place into 4 (since we borrowed two). Now, the expression looks like this: 12 - 91 + 4  \n2. Perform subtraction: 12 - 91 = -79  \n3. Add the previously borrowed 4: -79 + 4 = -75  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer for the expression 26 - 91 is -75.\n</think>\n<answer>-75</answer>\n<verifier_answer>-75</verifier_answer>"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Evaluate: 29 - 43."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think> \nProblem: Evaluate: 29 - 43.  \n\nReasoning:  \n1. Start with the expression, which is \"29 - 43.\"  \n2. In subtraction problems like this one, we follow the order of operations: first, subtract the smaller number from the larger number.  \n3. Here, 29 is the minuend (the number being minus another number), and 43 is the subtrahend (the number being taken away).  \n4. To solve this, we need to find the difference between these two numbers.  \n5. Since 29 is less than 43, we can't directly subtract them in one step. We need to borrow from the next place value (tens) of the minuend.  \n6. Borrowing 1 ten from 29 gives us 19 and changes it into 129 (adding 10 to the original 29).  \n7. Now, we can subtract: 129 - 43 = 86.  \n8. However, we borrowed a ten, so the result needs to be adjusted by subtracting that ten from the final answer, which gives us 86 - 10 = 76.  \n\nRecheck the steps, and it seems there was an oversight in my initial response. Correcting the calculation:  \n9. After borrowing, we have 129. Subtracting 43 from this gives us 86 (as calculated earlier). But remember, we borrowed a ten, so we must subtract that from our result.  \n10. Therefore, 86 - 10 = 76. However, since the original minuend was 29 and not 129, this means we need to compensate for the borrowing by adding back the ten we initially took away (as we cannot add it twice).  \n11. So, our final answer is 76 + 10 = 86.  \n\nCorrecting the discrepancy and concluding with the accurate result:  \n12. The correct calculation for \"29 - 43\" should involve borrowing and adjustments as outlined above. However, upon reevaluation, it's evident that a mistake occurred in my earlier reasoning. The correct approach is to recognize that when subtracting larger numbers, we may need to adjust our minuend by adding back what we initially borrowed (in this case, 10).  \n13. Therefore, the accurate calculation should be: 29 - 43 = -(43 - 29) = -(14), which means -14. This accounts for the fact that 43 is larger than 29, and we are subtracting a larger number from a smaller one, resulting in a negative value.  \n</think>  \n\n<answer>-14</answer>\n<verifier_answer>-14</verifier_answer>"}]}

First, perform multiplication: \n   47 * 90 = 4230\n   This is done because multiplication precedes addition in the order of operations (PEMDAS).\n\n2. Then, add the result to 21:\n   4230 + 21 = 4251\n\n   This step follows directly from the expression given, where '+' indicates we should add the numbers on either side.\n\nRecheck: \n   - Multiplying 47 by 90 indeed gives us 4230.\n   - Adding 21 to this result produces 4251.\n\nConclusion: The final answer is derived correctly based on the order of operations and the given expression.\n</think>  \n\n<answer>4251</answer>\n\n<verifier_answer>4251</verifier_answer>"}]}
