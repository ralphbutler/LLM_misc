The given expression is \"629 * 564 - 869.\" According to the order of operations (PEMDAS), multiplication should be performed before subtraction. So, we start by calculating the product of 629 and 564.\n   629 * 564 = 353887\n\n2. Now that we have calculated the product, we can perform the subtraction: 353887 - 869\n\n3.

However, since this result does not match the given answer of \"353887\", there seems to be a discrepancy between the provided solution and the calculation.
