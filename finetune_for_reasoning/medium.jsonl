According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we should perform division and multiplication before addition and subtraction.\n2. Starting with the first operation, divide -1596 by 7143. This gives us a negative result because we're dividing a negative number by a positive one: -1596 / 7143 = -0.223... (rounded to four decimal places for simplicity).\n3. Now, divide the previous result by 6648: -0.223... / 6648 \u2248 -0.000335... (again, rounded to four decimal places).\n4. Next, subtract this result from -4149: -(-0.000335...) + 4149 = 4149 + 0.000335... \u2248 4149 (the small value is negligible and does not affect the final answer).\n5.
