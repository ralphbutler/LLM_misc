While **no official, exhaustive classification exists for all 800 ARC puzzles**, and many puzzles blend multiple reasoning types, we can certainly provide more examples within the categories you mentioned and suggest others. Classifying them definitively is challenging because:

1.  **Subjectivity:** What one person sees as "object manipulation," another might classify as "pattern completion" or "local transformation."
2.  **Multiple Steps:** Many puzzles require a sequence of different reasoning types.
3.  **Novelty:** Some puzzles introduce unique logic that doesn't fit neatly into predefined categories.

However, based on common interpretations and analysis within the ARC community, here's a list of examples for each category, drawing from both the training (`*.json`) and evaluation (`*.json`) sets. This is *not* exhaustive but provides a good starting point for diverse testing.

### --------------------------------

**Key Reasoning Categories & Examples:**

1.  **Object Manipulation (Copy, Move, Rotate, Scale, Modify)**
    *   **Focus:** Identifying discrete objects and applying geometric or duplication transformations.
    *   `d037b0a7.json`: Moving a "hole" object.
    *   `67385a82.json`: Copying and repositioning parts of an object.
    *   `25d8a9c8.json`: Moving objects based on color/context.
    *   `6e82a1ae.json`: Rotating objects.
    *   `d43fd935.json`: Rotating/Flipping complex objects.
    *   `9f236235.json`: Scaling up objects (pixel repetition).
    *   `a61ba2ce.json`: Scaling objects (2x2 or 3x3 pixel blocks).

3.  **Pathfinding, Flood Fill, Connectivity**
    *   **Focus:** Drawing lines, filling areas based on connectivity, or checking reachability.
    *   `7b6016b9.json`: Drawing paths between points, avoiding obstacles.
    *   `a74caa49.json`: Flood fill based on color, stopping at boundaries.
    *   `4258a5f9.json`: Identifying connected components of the same color.
    *   `6455b5f5.json`: Drawing lines/paths based on specific rules.
    *   `27a28665.json`: Maze-like pathfinding or area identification.
    *   `dc0a314f.json`: Connecting points or filling regions based on endpoints.
    *   `b8cdaf2b.json`: Filling areas defined by boundaries.

4.  **Global Counting & Properties**
    *   **Focus:** Rules derived from counts of colors/shapes, object properties (size, shape category), or grid properties visible across the entire input.
    *   `b1948b0a.json`: Output depends on the count of specific colored cells.
    *   `c9e6f295.json`: Output grid size/color based on counts in the input.
    *   `e98196ab.json`: Identifying the object/color that is unique or occurs a specific number of times.
    *   `f25fbde4.json`: Identifying the largest object or object with a specific property.
    *   `46f33fce.json`: Output determined by properties (e.g., number, size) of shapes found.
    *   `a48eeaf7.json`: Output color determined by the majority color or counts.
    *   `91714a58.json`: Rules based on the *number* of distinct objects.

5.  **Local Pattern Matching & Conditional Transformation**
    *   **Focus:** Identifying small (e.g., 2x2, 3x3) patterns or pixel neighborhoods and applying transformations based *only* on that local context.
    *   `3aa6fb7a.json`: Replacing specific local patterns with other patterns.
    *   `5582e5ca.json`: Changing a pixel's color based on its immediate neighbors (cellular automata-like).
    *   `9d9285e0.json`: Identifying and modifying specific small shape patterns.
    *   `c1d99e64.json`: Conditional pixel changes based on neighbor configurations.
    *   `1f876c06.json`: Applying rules based on local context (e.g., is a pixel at a corner, edge?).
    *   `63613498.json`: Simple pattern replacement rules.

**Additional Useful Categories:**

6.  **Object Construction / Decomposition**
    *   **Focus:** Building new objects from primitives, drawing shapes based on properties of others (like bounding boxes), or breaking objects down.
    *   `ea786f4a.json`: Drawing bounding boxes around objects.
    *   `0b148d64.json`: Constructing lines or shapes connecting specific points.
    *   `aab92184.json`: Merging or combining input objects based on rules.
    *   `ae4f1146.json`: Separating interwoven or connected components.
    *   `d511f180.json`: Constructing an output shape based on input object features.

7.  **Grid / Geometric Operations**
    *   **Focus:** Transformations affecting the grid structure itself, like cropping, resizing (not just object scaling), tiling, or extracting subgrids.
    *   `db3e9e38.json`: Cropping the grid to the minimal bounding box containing non-background pixels.
    *   `6f8cd79a.json`: Similar to above, finding the relevant content area.
    *   `d2abd087.json`: Extracting specific rows/columns or subgrids.
    *   (Many pattern completion tasks like `b27ca6d3` also involve grid tiling logic).

**Recommendations for Training/Testing:**

1.  **Sample Diversely:** Don't just run many puzzles of the same type. Pick 1-3 *representative* examples from *each* of the categories above for your initial test suite.
2.  **Include Blends:** Actively look for puzzles that seem to combine categories (e.g., identify objects globally, then manipulate them locally). `67385a82` (Object manipulation + possibly local pattern detection for parts) is a good example.
3.  **Use Both Training & Evaluation:** Ensure your test set includes puzzles your system hasn't been explicitly trained on (if you're separating training/validation). The evaluation set (`*.json` files starting from `00...` in the Kaggle dataset folder structure, distinct from the training `*.json` files) is designed for this.
4.  **Analyze Failures:** When your program fails, try to categorize *why*. Was it unable to identify the objects? Did it fail at the geometric transformation? Did it misinterpret a global count? This helps guide development.
5.  **Consult Community Resources:** The ARC Prize website, associated GitHub repositories, and Kaggle competition discussions often contain analyses and categorizations of puzzles that can provide further insight.

By testing against a curated set covering these different reasoning types, you'll get a much better sense of your program's strengths and weaknesses than just running it on a single puzzle or a random subset. Good luck!
